## First task

I have created 2 approaches for this simple tasks.

You can test it and run it using

### PHP
php addNumbers/addNumbers.php
php addNumbers/addNumbersFunctionalKindOf.php

### JS

node addNumbers/addNumbers.js

## Second task


### PHP
php menu/example.php


### JS
node menu/menu.js



I have stared to work on sql / ORM implementation but it would take me to much of time

It has been broken but it gives some ideas
cd menu/PHPwithORM
composer install
php -S localhost:8000 -t menu/PHPwithORM


## Third task


### PHP
php birds/example.php

### JS
node birds/birds.js


## Fourth task

Birds can walk, swim and fly
php -S localhost:8000 -t birds/
http://localhost:8000/eagle/release
